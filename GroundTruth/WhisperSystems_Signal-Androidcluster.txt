Was many of the features of Whatsapp but with better privacy but missed messages mean can't be used.,4.1
The app is not supporting gifs in gBoard.,1.6
I have an email into the company to discuss this all update this when we have it figured out,1.2
etc Which R VIOLATION Of People's Privacy Rights & other Rights, AVOID THIS APP, OR Request Developers To Remove Those Features, OR Release "Light" Edition w/o Excessive & UnNecessary Data Accesses, OR release a Plugin which can access those Permission & this app connecting w/Plugin via encrypted API.,2.1
Can't register, keep showing connectivity error,1.5
Cannot register Signal for both him cards.,1.5
Cannot send pictures or GIFS.,2.3
Awesome if it works, but it constantly drops calls or fails to connect even when both phone are on iii.,2.2
Edit: now calls don't work at all.,2.1
Buggy, vehicle connect system never works with signal, routine miss calls,2.2
It is impossible to verify!!!,1.5
Really wanted to use it, but right off the bat when I set it as my default SMS app I cannot even see my own posts in transferred messages?,2.1
Six this and I will rate 5 star,4.2
for some reason i could not send a secured message.,2.2
An't add multiple images like Whatsapp does.,2.1
Will be great if this functionality can be added to the app.,3
The calls drop a lot, or you can't hear when you answer the call.,2.1
Also, I wasn't able to assign a specific ringtone to each contact.,2.2
MMS messages fail to download on of&T Soto X (2015), and there don't seem to be any manual MMS settings to attempt to debut things.,2.1
Great app, reduced the stars because I recently switched to Project Fi on a Pixel XL; works flawlessly for texting and receiving calls, but for some reason I cannot make calls.,2.1
Please fix, thank you!,4.2
I love the privacy features of this app, but I find it odd that you can't use voice recognition to create a text.,3
I don't want to send an audible message within my messaging app, I just want to have a hands-free option.,3
I can text gift to signal users just fine but regular text doesn't work.,2.2
Strangely, one of the groups is showing up but I cannot contribute.,2.2
I can send any message.,2.3
Can you please enable the user to decide the size font so the visually impaired under us can access this as well.,3
Give us the ability to lock messages so they cannot be delete.,2.1
Good but needs improvements An't make all calls.,2.2
People can't hear me.,2.1
And some texts cannot be sent.,2.1
Great and sucks An only trim messages not delete and trim does not work.,2.1
Notifications don't work Otherwise seems like a good messenger app but the notifications don't seem to work on ANY platform.,2.1
Good secure app but modifications are not working in my case even if Signal has all authorization in its settings and in system settings.,2.6
It constantly fills my notifications pull down with notifications of new contacts available.,4.1
It also refuses to fetch MMS messages, showing a connection error every time.,2.2
Doesn't work without data connection.,1.4
SoFar SoGood I had to uninstall as Signal WILDLY transmitted gibberish to ALL my contacts.,2.3
Can't even make calls Some blank screen is coming when I press call.,2.2
Frequent clashes after latest update.,1.2
Cant send a text message Since last update yesterday I cant send any messages.,2.2
Request I request a new feature to be added as soon as possible,that should be hiding,the telephone number of person,you are communicating so no one can read that number.,3
Can't text to a fellow Signal user offline In the beginning, Signal offered to replace my current SMS app.,2.2
I wanted Signal to be my default messaging app (online n office) but I can't do that if it will only work as an online messaging app,3
Can't Receive MMS on Motorola X Pure T-Mobile Network.,2.2
Does privacy pretty well, MMS sucks, needs features MMS does NOT work on T-Mobile!,2.2
There used to be a feature that supported T-Mobile MMS but it got removed.,2.2
Now it won't display any group texts or URLs or pictures!,2.2
Best available texting option Outrageous and unnecessary special permissions.,2.2
Does not work SIGNAL in ran.,2.1
The software does not work in the Islamic Republic of Ran.,2.1
Because of the serious filtered by the government.we must use VPN for use Signal.,2.2
Please try to fix the problem.,4.2
Recently it fails to deliver messages Recently, Signal fails to deliver messages on time.,2.1
Cannot set up I cannot get past the set.,2.1
Amazing app but too buggy to use One of the only apes fully greenlighted by the EFF but I can't keep missing calls daily.,2.2
Notifications don't work reliably Notifications often don't work for incoming messages using Android 4.4.6 - it does not notify until I manually re-open the app.,2.2
In overall its good messaging app with awesome security but fix some bugs and work more on the app design.,2.2
Cannot verify my sums I was in the process of setting up signal.,2.1
It failed to verify sums.,2.1
The next option was to call my phone and provide me with a code.,2.2
DeadliestCatch can't fight meshes cabs,4.1
Fail Doesn't work in Thailand.,2.2
So anyone in my contact list of 800 friends family and business contacts just shows up in Signal (without permission) and I can't remove them.2.2
Playstore LOL In one hand you provide privacy and in other you depend on a spyware.,2.2
This needs to be fixed.,4.2
Playstore LOL In one hand you provide privacy and in other you depend on a spyware.,4.2
Registering for this app is a nightmare The app tries to auto verify the text message it sends you, but it doesn't let you put the code in yourself, so if it fails to detect your code you have to wait 2 minutes before you can try again or try the phone call.,1.5
It's frustration you can't send images or write texts longer than 160 words to people who don't have the app,2.3
Keeps crashing After the last update.,1.2
The app keeps crashing every time i open the app.,1.3
Can't send messages with photos at all.,2.2
Camera doesn't work when the screen rotated.,2.2
WARNING Cannot back messages, transfer messages, or revert (back to Messages) with this app.,2.3
Once your messages are on Signal, they belong to signal, you cannot move them.,2.2
Don't believe the hype.,4.2
Thank you for including integrated quick reply, that is a welcome feature.,3
I have just installed the latest version to try your app but whatsapp is much faster in delivering messages and I was shocked that it doesn't provide phone calls as mentioned in the program features!,2.2
Even registration is not working It doesn't handle oncoming purification SMS and not allow to enter number annual.,2.2
I heard it's good but It doesn't change your number, I expected the number to change when testing someone, so you stay private.,2.2
It often fails to notify of new messages; it is reliable in sending messages ( contact report receiving the same message multiple times); some messages never arrive; sending pick is flay (file size limit).,2.3
Egypt still can't connect need vpn The app is good but in Egypt 7 Jan 17 still can't connect via normal way oy via vpn please find a way to fix it,2.2
Great app, has a few bags Sleek app for sending private messages and SMS.,4.1
Unhappy It constantly crashes,4.1
Need some improvements Cannot share PDF files.,2.1
I can't send or receive pick on my galaxy Of.,2.3
Works no so well for sums I do not receive some sums which is a real problem!,4.2
Don't call yourself free.,4.1
This means if I create a better app as a port, it can neither be called Signal (although I doubt that would hold up in court) nor communicate with the original Signal app.,2.2
Doesn't work without data network when you can usually send ordinary SMS without any problem without data network.,1.4
Also can't share/send pictures directly from the Salary.,2.3
It confirms that a SMS has arrived since it vibrates immediately when I request a cod, but nothing on Signal.,2.2
This is a GLARING bug.,2.2
What use is security if you can't use the app at all.,2.2
As it is now friends who once used Signal and then stopped using it cannot be contacted anymore from my Signal app as the messages are stuck in the cloud (they no longer use Signal).,2.2
(please fix ) Registering with server,1.5
Signal crashed when i tried to find contact while writing sums and purged my call log and all contact!,2.2
Can't see all contacts Trying to invite a contact which is present, but if I invite through this app it can't see some contacts.,2.1
I tried listing all the little annoyances but ran out of room.,2.1
Secondly, it doesn't support Cell Broadcast, so when an emergency broadcast (e.g., Amber Alert or other alert) is sent out, I have to go back to the regular messaging app to view it.,2.1
Encrypted requires data, desktop doesn't sms I appreciate this application allows for encrypted messaging, which is nice and is the purpose of the application.,2.1
I would like to be able to do this over SMS (though I realize that might not be technically feasible).,2.1
Now have 2 numbers for this person and can't get rid of old number.,2.1
Still fails to notify me about oncoming messages I find it a great concept.,3
However, the app fails to notify me on new oncoming messages.,2.2
For a security app you would think they could see how this could be VERY, VERY bad to have a person's presence announced!,2.1
The app would create multiple messages for 1 person, then when I would tap on a ratification, the app would take me to a conversation that I couldn't reply to the person in because "the number wasn't 10 digits".,2.1
Not a fully flushed out testing solution Is a stand-alone encysted message solution, Signal is great and deserves 5 stars.,4.1
Problem Want verify phone number.,2.1
Fix it!,4.2
Loved it but couldn't count on it.,4.1
The problem is that if signal isn't open in memory, it won't notify the recipient of a message.,2.1
Also size limits make it so you can't send video or gift....trash,2.3
Would love to use the app, but registration keeps on failing at the last step (failed to connect to server.),1.5
Any advice?,4.2
An't send messages,2.3
My only single problem is that I don't understand why image quality is scaled down to send.,2.2
MMS (Still) Doesn't Work Still cannot receive MMS.,2.5
But when I tried to make it my default SMS I learned there's a 300KB limit to MMS.,2.2
Tried to set Signal as the default SMS app, it receives the message, shows a notification, but the verification process still fails?!,2.2
I have to open signal in order to get any kind of notification.,2.2
Fix that and you get five stars.,4.2
Good messenger Good but when are you going to fix the invite friends double contact bug?,2.2
It's good But it'll freeze from time to time and it'll forget my contacts so I'll be stuck with everyone's number instead of their names.2.1
Mrs not working on Of Edge/ of&T Everything working except sending and receiving photo messages to users not on the same app.,2.1
No notifications Seemed like a great app, but impractical to use because you have to "wake it up" first before it delivers messages.,2.1
Gave the update a try - same problem.,2.1
Delivary report problem plzzz guys,we cant see the delivary report timing of a message we sent,otherwise all is best .,2.1
This may be a sleek, fast and aesthetically-pleasing app but when it doesn't do it's primary job, there's no excuse for that.,2.1
I'm not the only one who has had this issue with the app, from people on different carriers (I'm on Print),2.1
However, I had to switch back to my default messenger app, because too many of my messages were failing to send, I couldn't participate in group texts, the app would close when it was supposed to just minimize, and I couldn't send multimedia messages.,2.3
Not So Great Seamlessly replaces your default texting application while protecting your privacy, But once you transfer your conversations into the app, there isn't a way to get them back out.,2.1
Fails to download images sometimes.,2.1
Doesn't do voice calls It's always telling me network failed every time I try to make a voice call,1.4
Keyboard wouldn't work anymore, had to switch back to the standard messenger on my Soto Z Force.,2.1
Needs goose services to run Also Cannot register in India, may be some kind of block by internet provider.,1.5
Doesn't work on certain iii network.,1.4
disabling Signal messaging fixed this.,2.2
Pls include Oman also for censorship facility as it's blocked here,2.2
No sign up Oman I tried to sign up but no use , it's blocked completely in Oman.,2.2
NOT WORKING the calls is not working for me only chat,4.1
Doesn't work with Google voice And it doesn't say so in the description on the play store.,2.5
WHY CAN I NOT SET of CUSTOM RINGTONE FOR CALLS?,2.2
Failed to register Always failed during register.,1.5
I'll remove this today but its too late now for all the six I can't see.,4.2
Texts from other signal and regular sums are not shown for days.,2.2
I do like the program in itself, but it fails at its core function,2.1
paraphrase doesn work?,2.1
A bit hard to read the received messages Due to the colors in the received messages, I have problems reading them.,2.1
That is a problem as some of them have been time-critical and I can't sit opening the app constantly.,2.1
Doesn't send texts any more Doesn't work,2.3
It works I don't like how you can't send to multiple recipients, and the emotions look substandard.,2.2
Attachment I can't always attach a photo to my text,2.1
Doesn't work right, disappointing Does not consistently send/receive messages often just fails.,2.2
Messages not going through Also have people I'm sending messages to getting an error that my number has changed (or something like that, but nothing has changed).,2.2
I can only send 3 messages and then it won't send anymore for about an hour but I still receive messages.,2.3
The biggest problem is that it takes over from your default phone app and called of often doesn't work.,2.1
The delivery reports are not working correctly on Horizon SMS and just return with an error that every message was not sent (although they are sent fine).,2.2
I got the SMS with the code but the app says "SMS purification failed".,2.2
Good security bad without wife Vs there is a need for wife for the encryption to work but it wont send messages without it ak it doesn work as a standard messenger!,2.6
I can not send privately locked messages to my muddy in the of.,2.2
Same problems!,4.2
Does not handle pictures and attachments very well most pictures that are taken by my S5 will not attached to a message directly you have to take the picture to the camera first then attach it because it doesn't like picture sizes that the S5 natively does This program does not handle attachments from taking pictures Well if you take a picture through this app you won't be able to attach it because the native picture size for a Samsung S5 is too big this program really has some features need to be added to compete with the standard messenger that comes with Android that allows you to reduce the size of the picture if it's too big or at least this app should allow for Native pictures from the camera on any Samsung S5 to be handled by this messaging app,2.2
Must not be compatible with my android phone because the "security " text sending isn't available.,2.2
Deleted app because I believe it doesn't work.,4.1
You can't get help from a person only answers on forum.Sorry that it's not what I thought.,2.2
It's ok but not great I don't like how you can't tell if the recipient has seen the message and whether they are tying or not,2.2
And, so far, I've been unable to text or phone my girlfriend, who I convinced to install it.,2.2
That's unable to text at all, not unable to text securely (I could probably return to using Messenger and text from there, but that renders this app completely painless.),2.1
I can't even get this piece of cap to ever let me log-in!,1.5
And I haven't been able to get any teach support for several months now.,4.1
It can't get any louder or more worthless than that!,4.1
Its interface looks impressive, but if it won't let you ever log-in, and you can never get any help or teach support, then it is totally worthless.,1.5
Doesn't work on wife without cell service.,1.4
Can't attach the gifs offered says thier too big.,4.1
But images are far too compressed over SMS, can't see detail.,2.2
Some features don't work For some reason the gift won't attach/send when using Signal with SMS/MMS,2.3
Can't install error code -11,1.1
Can't disable peeking notifications,2.2
edit: there are some really annoying issues with this app - it changes my contact name to their numbers and WONT let me change them.,2.2
I'm trying to give it a fair shake but I bet you are gone before the day ends.,2.2
don't use this app,4.1
Then the app seems to crash after this happens and i can't make more calls.,2.2
Best in it's class, would be great if I could limit contacts Works and is from what I can tell the most secure option.,2.2
Not working for LGV20 I receive messages from others but when I try and send messages I get a ratification that says message not sent and that an issue needs addressed but it doesn tell me what the issue is.,1.6
When I try to send sms to her, Siganl sent it thru internet thru signal network and not SMS, so she NEVER get the messages.,2.2
Bug submission Phone call over Bluetooth fails to end the call after it was finished,2.2
Good I love it and I will send you that please you have to do it.,2.2
Can't scan qr Won't focus on desktop app qr.,2.2
Signal calling does not work well, calls constantly dropping, or barely being able to hear voices not to mention once that happens it stays ringing in my speaker until I start my phone.,2.2
I'll update my review shortly after testing with the stock SMS app.,2.2
Recent update added a camera button in the text box and I always press it now - this has got to change,2.2
Problem is it force closes after a couple of messages.,2.1
Desperately needs "Move to SD Card" Removed two stars because it can't be moved off local memory.,2.7
MMS issues and errors App is great from traditional sms testing.,2.2
However MMS constantly has issues with errors such had mrs message download failed.,2.5
Support to date has been worthless to fix the constant and on going app error.,2.1
It won't work with FreedomPop!,2.2
THIS APP CAN HOSE YOUR SETTINGS SO BADLY, YOU HAVE TO DO A FULL FACTORY RESET LIKE I DID.,2.2
Only some conversations show up on desktop, and I can't figure out the pattern of which, I'm pretty sure it's not just Signal users.,2.2
Buggy and not secure You must give everyone your phone number, messages barely ever send and it has no locking pass code on certain platforms.
still not working,4.2
However, I wiped away an important conversation and can't locate the archive view (that's mentioned on the webster) to recover the archive conversation.,2.1
Please fix, thank you!,4.2
No MMS I suspect the issue is my Verizon/Page Plus provider, but after many attempts I can't completely import from the stock Verizon Message+ nor receive MMS attachments.,2.2
Can't load new people Don't need a simple app that requires a manual,2.2
If not a straight NSA front, it won't be long before they infiltrate the company via the now-well-documented plethora of options available.,2.2
Broke Not working,4.2
It said calling Why would you advertise you can call if you can't call at all and for a private app you sure do want a lot of unrelated information .,2.2
It said calling Why would you advertise you can call if you can't call at all and for a private app you sure do want a lot of unrelated information .,2.1
Liked it more before it started displaying wasn't able to send text then didn explain why.,2.1
Or if it does, it's so hidden that even a professional interface designer couldn't figure out how to do it.,2.8
However, MMS is a nightmare when you use this app to talk to someone who isn't...for states, I can never receive MMS, always says the download failed.,2.5
I wasn't able to enter my purification number.,2.2
Sms verification in Bosnia doesn't work.
If someone does not download this App I cannot find them to txt.,2.2
it does not work it will not let me register my one number it goes through all purification and then at the last bit says no connection make it work with goose play too .,1.5
im in the uk so maybe your app is been blocked
Offline encysted sums Why I can not send office encysted SMS?,2.3
Does not work correctly with dual him phone (at least on OnePlus 3), always tries to send the message using first him.,2.2
MMS Doesn't Work Good interface, great idea for security, but MMSs are worked.,2.8
Wtf annoying af Used to work fine then one day decided to not work like before and now it doesnt let me send picture messages whatsoever to anyone.,2.2
Too many permissions It's a neat app, but it requires so many permissions for a lot of features I do not use.PLEASE FIX,2.2
PLEASE FIX,4.2
Btw I made donations and appreciate your hard work
not safe requires phone verificaton and transmits contact info.,2.2
I had to give up When you can install it the app is great, works well and fast and allows to send and receive all your messages.,2.2
Unfortunately it will not update on older phone and it will stop working.,2.2
the previous update I could finally install it after many failed trials, but this latest it keeps failing the installation (error code -11), so finally I had to give it up.,1.1
But sometimes things fail to send or receive even when I'm in wife Internet range.,1.4
The app sometimes fails to send messages, especially if they're longer.,2.2
I'd have rated higher if it didn't keep bugging me to message people I haven't spoke to in years and, in many cases, don't want to speak to ever again just because they too have signal installed.,2.2
Other than that, it works well, it renowned for being the best encrypted messaging app, and everybody should be using encryption so download it now,2.2
Was working great, until I couldn't recieve calls.
The problem is since the last update I don't get modifications of new messages until I open the app mentally.,2.2
People will tell me they sent me a message then I will click on the app to open it and it will alert me but not until then, which is a serious problem.,2.2
Hopefully this will be fixed in the next update.
MMS Good app, does not work well for .,2.5
Fix the bugs I keep getting an error occurred that message was not received even though it was.,2.2
Sometimes has bags It doesn't always give me ratification for massage and sometimes blocks me from sending massage and l don't know why,2.1
Crap Can't even send a simple sms,2.2
I switched phones (I did not have any issues before) and on my new phone contacts are only displayed as phone numbers (versus as names) in conversations.,2.2
I also can't respond to preexisting group messages.,2.3
And now it is removed.,2.2
Emoji's and emoticons don't work.,2.2
Don't broadcast that I'm using your app.,4.1
Shouldn't notify phone contacts when you create an account, especially without giving you an option.,2.1
Nice concept but very buggy, crashes and frequently fails to send messages.,2.1
Won't let me text in the group I started and others in the group have the same issues.,2.1
Can't send a picture or a screenshot I just downloaded the app.,2.3
I may be going back to my default text app if I can't send pictures.,2.3
It doesn't work well,4.1
Can't really send to multiple contacts without first creating a group.,2.3
Can't include additional contacts when relying to a message.,2.1
can send a message to another number of the same contact name simply because it only displays first number.,2.1
Couldn't Even Signup!,2.1
Endless crashes Can't even test it, I start typing and it crashes by the fourth word.,2.1
is it possible to have this app work with mightytext?
Functional but UI is terrible Could really use some touchups to resemble a modern communications app more than a sms app from 5 yrs ago (like less wastage of space in the message bibles so that more info can be gleamed with a single glance, read receipts etc).,2.1
Can't send messages,2.3
This breaks it as alot of banks etc are special numbers where sms fails if +91 is added in front.,2.1
And provided there is no option to remove the +91 is a deal breakers as now I can send sums to that number.,2.2
When I tap on a number in a mug can I not get an option to send an sums that number in addition to just calling him?,2.1
Total garage Wouldn't work.,4.1
The major issue is that if your contacts stop using signal then you can no longer message them easily.,2.1
The major issue is that if your contact stop using signal then you can no longer message them easily.,2.1
You have to long press the send button for each individual message to change how the messages sent.,2.1
could not installed message said error -11.i have wasps already installed, maybe it's related to that?,1.1
Signal worked like a charm on my old phone, but now with my Peri of, it doesn't work at all.,2.2
It wont even start, it just gives me that lovely "Unfortunately Signal has crashed.",1.3
When this is fixed, I will gladly fix my rating back to 5 stars where it should be.,2.1
Used to like it, but since nought, app clashes while verifying SMS.,2.2
Can't even register it.,2.1
Dunno if signal or android is at fault, but this doesn't work
Blocking contact not working Android M 6.0.1 Oneplus 2 I blocked a contact but they are still able to call me.,2.2
Doesn't work without data connection.,1.4
Doesn't work with two SIM Cards Registered on Signal with number of SIM Card 2 and even if I disable my SIM Card 1 Signal keeps trying to send messages via SIM Card 1.,2.1
Two major issues Letting people who have me in their contact that I am now using Signal is a serious breach of privacy.,2.1
The hell I had to send an important message and I couldn't send it and then none of the messages would send all of a sudden I've only had this thing for a day.,2.1
The hell I had to send an important message and I couldn't send it and then none of the messages would send all of a sudden I've only had this thing for a day.,2.3
I tried to uninstall and reinstall and the only thing that happened was it told me my phone doesn't have service or signal how are you going to create a message system free encrypted important messages and then not be able to send them?,2.1
Fix it.,4.2
Please fix, as I love this app!!!!,4.2
Can't chose your algorithm or key length.,2.1
Install fails (package error) Fig fan of signal, but unfortunately since the last update I am not able to neither update or reinstate the app.,1.1
I had this issue previously (by mid 2016) and it was solved, but now the same thing again (Sov 2016),2.2
Can not send messages At first everything was ok and app was working fine, but after some time it stopped to send messages to some of the people in my contact list, especially ones who has signal too.,2.1
Do not spend time on this app, either they should make app working or do not make it.,2.1
As there will be situations when you need urgently send message but app is not working, sorry bug.,2.1
Also, I can't unload video to messages any longer.,2.1
Cant send files or vcards I love this app but not having the ability to send someone my v-card just ruins this app in every way,2.1
On reinstalling certain groups do not work well.,2.1
I cannot post on the groups while I can see posts.,2.1
Migrating to a new phone is very awkward, some things don't work and it's not obvious how to fix those.,2.1
Great app on iPhone but the android version seems to be kinda glitchy Phone has a few issues on Android like sometimes it can't keep a call and when integrating it as your main texting app it erases messages.,2.1
It keeps its self open sometimes and actually locked me into a group making it so I could not reply or get out of the group.,2.2
Don't be so needy.,2.2
Such, cannot play video's sent from Android to iOS , apple devices won't play any video due to an unsupported formats in iPhone6 & later , it,s fine between Android devices !2.2

Issues with international texts Is anyone having issues testing someone out of the states?,2.3
Pretty much everyone i had convinced to use Signal had the same problem, now we're all back to WhatsApp.,2.2
Not to mention that now my friends withOUT signal now can get my group texts.,2.2
Blocking Not much good since you can't block texts by prefix numbers and/or by using willard characters.,2.2
Hmm sprint is not letting me verify this It was verified but sprint put out an update shortly after it was installed for the sole purpose of disabling it, every phone service is spying on its customers and they lose money when they cant harvest that data,2.2
Please help The program has been crashing as soon as opened.,1.3
My friend just died and I can't retrieve my conversations.
Signal seems to take privacy to the point of deciding I myself can't view some messages sent to me, tossing them down the memory hole, never to be retrieved.,2.2
Also, it'd be nice to have a few more colours to choose from.
Unreliable and Devs Refuse to Fix This app has two issues 1 i can live with and one I cannot.,2.1
In my own testing the issues seem to be that the the app doesn't play well with message.,2.2
The Debut system they use can't capture the issue so for them it doesn't exist.,2.1
