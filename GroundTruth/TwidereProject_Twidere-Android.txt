How to make polls and turn on notifs?,2.8
Nice interface, some problems though Why can I not view interactions like when someone follows me, likes my tweet or retweets?,2.8
Sharing is still a problem.,2.1

But sometimes it's too slow and has problems in loading videos and pictures.,2.2
Favorite client, but buggy I'm using Twidere over all other options but it has persistent issues.,2.2
And also the notification behaves poorly, and doesn't update the new tweet count based on the count in the app - the only thing that sets the notification count to zero is swiping away the notification, not actually reading tweets.,2.2

Token Limitations Please fix the Limit Token ASAP!!!,1.5
Don't have fav and retweet notifications and tab for that?!,3
Excellent UI, but buggy I love a lot about this application, but it does have bugs.,2.8
Sometimes it won't refresh and I have to force close it and open it back up.,1.2
Also, there is no view within the app for notifications and clicking on favorite/retweet counters doesn't show who favorited/retweeted.,2.8
Dislike the way I can't just have a notifications tab.,2.8
I can't click the stuff under the activity tab,2.2
No longer works for its purpose.,4.2
It just says 'sending tweet' for hours in the notifications.,4.2
And the way it loads or the way the notification tab is done is terrible.,2.8
Few deal-breakers are: refresh jumps to top of timeline rather than remembering your place, no in-app browser, cannot choose alternate image upload service.,2.1
Can't see who has retweeted a tweet, or who has faved.,2.1
Doesn't work Installed with app key and everything, but it doesn't work.,1.3

Doesn't show me how many letters have left to type in a direct message.,2.3
When I typed too long or was blocked by message limit Twidere didn't give any error message to explain it.,2.2
the only problem I have is how do you view peoples photos from their profile?,2.8
Still can't post tweets in 0.3.0, with either my API keys or the official ones.,2.1
Often I have to restart it in order for it to return to function properly!,2.1
Please fix,4.2
I'm not sure if this issue with the app or my account so I'm not going to hold the Ap responsible but there was a lot of lag issues and issues trying to post and follow other people on Twitter.,2.2
Please fix,4.2
cannot edit the profile,2.1
OK there's a bug, when u are trying to reply, app set user nickname after @, not twitter user name.,2.2

But one problem is that I can't play video with sound.,2.2
Doesn't show notifications or DMs.,2.8
And after a while it just freezes up.,1.3
It has ridiculous loading times, sometimes not even loading the tweet/picture/profile and instead giving you an error.,2.2
Buggy and slow, but decent interface and features This would be 4, maybe 5 stars if notifications weren't a problem.,2.8
Trending doesn't work,2.1
Problem I simply can't log in here.,1.5
I can't send pics from DM,2.1
Can't create tabs so I can't get it to work.,2.1
It loads an incredibly small number of tweets at a time upon refresh, and hitting the Load More line fails to load the tweets in between.,2.2
but after being a long time, it can't get to refresh the older post.,2.2
fix please.,4.2
Love the look, and it's quite smooth most of the time, but it crashes from time to time, and with the latest update (I think), the Load More button after the most recent tweets doesn't seem to work - loading icon appears for a half second the goes, and the tweets aren't shown.,2.1
But can't seem to tweet photos from camera or gallery.,2.1
Fix this and I'll give it a 5,4.2
Why can't I hear the audio when videos play?,2.1
One big problem for HTC One m7 When I play videos in the app there is no sound.,2.2
I really like it but fix this twitter video problem & it's great,2.2
I would love this app if it functioned to the point where I could use it to replace the official Twitter app.,4.2
But at the moment I don't feel it can.,4.1
Going back to Twitter I have had some time on this Twitter client and I cannot say that I am wow-ed.,4.1
(3) I can't find an obvious way to read a tweet in context of a conversation, which makes many tweets useless.,2.8
Can't open it Force stop!,1.3
There are some feauture that are not here.,4.2
I can't seem to find and to be notified of the people that favorite and retweeted my tweets and I can't find my old pictures that I posted because there's no "gallery/media".,2.2
Fix these and I'll change my ratings to 5 stars.,4.2

Will come back if You fix the image uploading option.,2.8
I cannot change my Twitter profile pic and background image through this app.,2.1
I can't add the tabs.,2.1
DM I can't view the previous conversations in .,2.1
Wtf It keeps giving me error 401 i dont know what to do,2.1
Good but had an annoying bug I only check Twitter a few times a day so I keep this app in offline mode.,2.2
When I manually refresh, it only loads a few (no more than 15 tweets) at a time, so I have to manually update many times to see what I've missed.,2.2
One problem for me though is the refresh circle does not go away when on the trending tab.,2.2
Please fix,4.2
The problem is I can't hear the sounds of any video ...video starts without sounds,2.2
1/5 on Nexus 9: the tablet interface has this pointless noisy columnar layout, and it crashes ridiculously often.,1.6
Notifications don't work and fav/rt counts don't tally.,2.1

Fix it, fix it fast,4.2
Rubbish It Can't show all replys' twitters,4.1
Please fix,4.2
Nice app How do you sign out can't find it.,2.8
[Update]: I can't received any notification from the app even I already enable it, before the material design update there is no problem at all.,2.2
-- I love this app, but there is small problem with notifications, please we need more options for the way of received it, I mean more professional, for example I can't replay the mention one by one in the notification section of my phone, because it's together and simply it's impossible to do what I want with this style.,3
Does not work out of the box Triggers 404 error on attempt to login.,1.5
Instead new design that shows less tweets, more buttons, crashes after every tweet, deleted settings after update etc.,2.2
Share function no longer works.,2.1
I love Twidere, but I use the share function extensively and with the last update it no longer works.,2.1
Now it doesn't WORK AT ALL.,1.3

Crashes Can't add a Mentions tab without it crashing EVERY SINGLE TIME.,1.3
Okay Ive got a prob , i cant get my whole timeline except for my profile only.,2.2

Does not show conversation replies Love this twitter client however the app does not show the conversation replies to a specific tweet.,2.1
Also, it does not show the multiple pictures listed on one tweet.,2.3
In terms of bugs I cannot see reply threads at all.,2.1
I can't change my profile photo now.,2.1
I'd give 5 stars if u fix the problem,4.2

Far far far from perfect But i cant find a better twitter client than this app.,4.1
Can not refresh when internet connection is poor,1.4
Can't scroll through images It says it supports multiple media.,2.2
I can't seem to scroll through tweet images.,2.2
Is there a way to do this?,4.2
I can't get my timeline tweets to load?,2.1

It's good, but On my phone everything is good till i noticed when i long press home button i got error.,2.2
Nice but limited Doesn't show anything from my feed.,2.2
I like how you can edit the theme color and make the background transparent.,2.8
Overall, an OK app, would be great if they improve some parts.,4.1
Not what i expected Couldn't post a photo easily.,2.2
Couldn't auto refresh.,2.1
How you going to give all that then have one little notification switch that does not work.,2.1
As soon as Twidere gets working notifications, I'll never go back to Twitter.,4.1
More than that actually, I love it...except notifications don't work.,2.1
I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling.I've changed every possible setting.I've reboot multiple times but to no avail.,1.1
