I can't even uninstall and try again.,1.1
Great app but syncing has stoapped Much better than the official app but the synchronisation no longer works.,2.7

Unfortunately, recently it won't log me on, so when I'm out, I can't log the caches I find.,1.5
I've read someone else has had the same problem and even reinstalling it doesn't work.,1.1
However, since the android update to marshmallow it just keeps crashing.,1.2
I now can't even open it.,2.1
Now it won't let me log on.,1.5
I couldn't get a map to open or any locations.,2.1

New update freezes Droid Turbo!,1.2
It doesn't work at all.,4.1
Doesn't work on my phone!,4.1
I have had nothing but problems with this app.,4.1
Issues with compass The compass on Moto G is even more dysfunctional then it was before.,2.1

Honestly it's always had major issues with this phone and no one is fixing that.,2.1
The cache comes up on the map, I'm signed in okay, but it just says 'unknown error' when I try to download or view caches on my Moto G. Bit of a shame.,2.1

My wife has the same problem.,4.2

app does not provide an easy way to simply open a map and see nearby sites.,3
maybe the developer wants to take a look at munze app.,4.1
Wouldn't work,4.2
Login unsuccessful, partial data Lots of potential but refuses to log in and freezes, also only downloads only partial data so finding the cache is a guessing game.,1.5
Will re-rate if I can ever actually get full function.,4.1
Lately it won't let me log caches as well and caches that I've logged in the past won't show up as "logged.",1.5
Quick easy and effective but last 2 updates keep freezing.,1.2
Can't write in log book!!!,2.1

I can't get it to make an account.,1.5
Using the official app I downloaded this app to use with the companion app for wear, but the wear navigation keeps crashing.,1.3
Now, the compass has a big issue that makes it exponentially harder to find a cache: When rotating the phone, the compass either doesn't react at all or moves slowly in random directions.,2.1
Both have the same issue, so I excluded the gyroscope as an error source.,2.1
Do not try The official geocashe app is 100% better.,4.1
Confusing I couldn't figure out how to use it,2.1
Crashes several apps in my phone app works find but since I installed it, several apps started to crash.,1.3
Poor Doesnt work.,2.1
It has the basics but it didn't load everything and was somewhat difficult to understand.,4.1
But now I can't get it to log in or map the cache.,1.5
Crashes my Z1 compact After switching to the new app it keeps crashing my phone.,2.1

Login issues For some reason I can't login to the app.,1.5
Cannot find out how to log in to the app.,1.5
Keeps telling me that the login failed.,1.5
Not working lately!,4.2
This app used to be great, but now the map view and live map aren't working for me.,2.1
I have to actually save a cache before I can see it's location on the live map, or map view, otherwise it says 0 caches.2.1

Not sure what happened but please fix!,4.1

Works reasonably well, but could really use a UI rework.,2.8
Just starting off I'm just starting off.4.2
I created a login but the app won't let me login so far.,1.5
Used to love it I've had this app for over a year and am now having problems with the compass.,2.1
Please fix,4.2
Good app Really pleased with this app - however it has a tendency to freeze when using it in live mode over 3G, I have to close the app and restart it in order to unfreeze it - quite annoying when you are trying to find caches.,1.3
Why is it that you can't log offline and upload logs at the same time as before,1.5
Cant keep steady GPS signal Ever since the new update app no longer keeps a steady gps signal.,1.2
Please fix,4.2
Premium members Couldn't check out many of the cache s because they were for premium members only.,3

How do I fix it?,4.1

Only issue is with compass Compass not working on s4, other apps have no issues.,2.1	
Can't log in at all even after in install and reinstall.,2.7
Can't download!,4.2
My main criticism is a) You cannot set a cache as a 'target' & have all other caches in order of distance from this one, & b) If you log all of your finds 'off-line', when you get connected to wifi, you cannot upload all of your finds without going into each one & uploading individually.,2.1
Was not happy With full internet still had problems with all info would not pull it up for me.,2.1
I just got an update, but can't figure out how to navigate to caches.,1.2
Since the update it fails to log in regardless of app/device restarts.,1.2
Every update erases my saved info It angers me that every time I have to update my app, I lose my saved lists and waypoints.,1.2
Not working!,4.2
"Liked" it I don't know if things have changed but I can't save caches for offline use.,2.1
I tried uninstalling it but still nothing.,2.1
Couldn't validate Spent an hour trying to validate my account, uninstalled.,1.5

Every cashe we try to find gives me an error stating "cgeo doesn't know the location of this cache".,2.1
There are so many bugs in this app.,4.1
If I try to load more than 3 pages, the page goes blank.,2.1
Half the time, the app won't work period and just says "logging in" at the bottom, but never logs in.,1.5
Once you fix these issues I will rate at 5 stars.,4.1
Please fix,4.2

Can't get past anything to access the app at all further than user name on geocaching.com.,2.1
Different kind of "geocaching" I don't like that this type of geocaching is trivial and you have to search several boxes to figure out the whole thing, they turned geocaching into the game of clue.,2.1

Waste of time Was all excited about doing this..spent 2 hours running in circles and didn't find anything..it would tell me 5 meters this way..get there and it would be 10 meters that way..would rather be fishing.,4.1
Only big problem I have is that it keeps brining up caches that I have already found!,4.1

Rarely 'Logs In' Would be nice if I could see every route.,1.5
It is nearly impossible and trying to explain to a newbie is downright exhausting.,2.1
Ok A lot of times it doesn't show geocaches on the map there are there.,2.1
Makes it unreliable as it can't be trusted.,2.1
The app simply fails to load ALL caches, A few other reviewers also state this same issue.,2.1
I have no such problem using another app available on play.,4.2
Can't log in Won't log into my account and can't log any caches.,1.5
Doesn't work well Force closes all the time, will not load caches on map, eats battery
