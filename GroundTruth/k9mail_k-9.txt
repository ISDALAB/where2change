5.203 has two big problems.,1.2
THANKS FOR FIXING THIS: The last two updates (this year) broke message reply..,1.2
Please fix.,4.2
After recent updates, Mark read in notification does not work.,1.2
I've been usinh this since the start, but the last update really need some fixing ASAP!!,1.2
The attachment need to go back to the TOP not bottom, why would anyone wants to scroll all the way down just to view the attachment?,2.1
Second, the loading takes more time just to read email.,2.1
New update still same problem.,1.2
What happened to PGP all of the sudden not working.,2.1
Authentication failed for all Gmail accounts.,2.1
Installed, and reinstalled, many times, the same problem persist.,2.7
Pls fix the bug for all attachment to show on top of message and not all the way below message.,1.1
Why would you change things like read all confirmation, and it won't clear notifications from notification bar now.,3
Latest update is useless, pinch to zoom doesn't work, crashes regularly and runs ridiculously slowly please fix it urgently.,1.2
Loved this mail app on my older phone w/ Gmail, but on my current phone I cannot get it to work with Yahoo email.,1.6
After last update it is almost impossible to zoom in/out.,1.2
When it won't let you zoom out, the emails can't be read and this app becomes useless.,2.1
Some messages won't allow either to happen even though I was able to with previous versions.,1.2
Pinch to zoom isn't working.,2.1
Can zoom in using expanding two fingers but then can't scroll to view all parts of the email and can't pinch to re-shrink the email.,2.1
Used to be good, butnthe new version crashes constantly, even when I am using other apps.,1.3
Please fix.,4.2
Changes the data tables so reverting might be impossible.,3
Why would you release something so bad when it used to be good?,1.2
Please fix.,4.2
Failure After latest update emails won't load and you can't download attachments.,1.2
K-9 mail user I can't any longer save the attachments to storage.,2.1
Please fix.,4.2
Not respecting poll settings I have added an email account that I don't have access to anymore, but I'd still like to have the emails available.,3
I am constantly reminded that the authentication failed.,2.3
Can you fix this please?,4.2
Will give it 5 star when problem is removed.,4.2
Please fix these problems.,4.2
Latest updates have destroyed great app No crashes ever until 2017 updates now crashes every 30 seconds.,1.2
Cannot read a full email before it crashes.,1.3
Freezes and crashes incessantly, and sometimes eats messages in composition I have been using K-9 Mail for over 2 years due to being stuck with POP3 service on Verizon, and K-9 Mail has increasingly tended to freeze up and sometimes crash; after the update to the latest version available on January 3, 2017, it stopped working entirely.,1.3
Last update ruined it After last update "Mark as read" from the notification bar no longer works reliable if you have multiple accounts.,1.2
Can't zoom in emails Since the last update, pinch to zoom does not work when reading emails anymore.,1.2
Was great but latest update has stopped pinch zoom working if it's not fixed soon will be moving to blue mail.,1.2
There are probably more problems, but I don't want look for them.,4.2
Update ruined it Was working fine but now it only sometimes updates the inbox with new emails after polling and pinch to zoom doesn't work properly any more.,1.2
This sudden inability to zoom is rendering that pointless if I can't read the messages on my phone.,2.1
Does not work Spent countless time trying to get gmail to work.,2.1
Keep getting errors.,2.1
When you try to contact K-9 support you get a message that tells you that any message to that address will be ignored.,2.3
Only way to get help is through their forum and nobody replies.,3
This provides a much more predictable ui.,2.8
Now can't send emails from one of my accounts - UPDATE: fixed by recreating accounts, every folder had to be recreated.,2.7
The app now crashes every so often, didn't happen before.,1.3
Though it has a lot of funtionalities, but not for me because I am a casual email checker who fails to organize inboxes with it.,2.1
PLEASE fix!,4.2
It crashes, force-closes, and when I reply to messages all the text that I am replying to is a dark blue and cannot be seen.,1.3
I even downloaded earlier versions to install, but V5.0 which 'might' fix the problem fails to see my import back-up file.,1.1
I'm a long-time user, but will have to switch apps if this isn't fixed.,3
Now all of a sudden it won't fetch my pop server email!,2.1
Unfortunately, started crashing every minute.,1.2
Can't give higher rating until latest updates get fixed..,1.2
Works pretty good I can't always reply or delete from the notification window.,2.1
Was great till update Since the last update, trying to zoom in on text in messages is impossible..,1.2
Mark as Read Notification Bar not Working Updated Review 1/7/17: for the last month I haven't been able to use the Mark As Read button in the Notification Bar.,2.1
Don't think I'll use another mail app after this!,2.1
First time user of app and like the look and customization options however the syncing issue is a problem.,2.3
Now you can't pinch the screen to change the font size.,2.2
K9 somehow fail to detect cryptography app installed after the latest update.,1.2
Can't save any attached file Version 5.202 cannot save any attached file in an e-mail to phone.,2.7
Had to cease using it Can't use two-factor authentication with Yahoo or Gmail.,2.1
Used to like it Crashes constantly.,1.3
I also don't understand why i cannot move emails in trash (deleted in error) back into my inbox!,4.1
In the trashcan they cannot be fully loaded or replied to.,2.2
You ruined this app I've been using K-9 for years and loved it.,4.1
There are so many issues after the last update that had to uninstall the app and go to a different client.,1.2
Problem with Scrolling Used to work smoothly and fast, but after the latest update the scrolling and zooming inside emails are a pain.,1.2
Main issues, for me, are account sizes now showing arbitrary large values even when completely empty & that the app now appears randomly laggy.,2.1
Really liked this app, so please roll back & fix issues in meantime.,4.1
More update issues Was a great mail app until the latest update (been using it for several years).,1.2
Emails show up now very small font and I cannot expand it with my fingers.,2.1
Now you can't even change the displayed names of contacts, I don't want to send mgs with the name on contact list.,2.1
But worse you can't see text on msg if it considers is a thread msg, even when threaded view is off.,2.1
Please give us back the older version,2.1
If I don't see a fix or some sort of announcement indicating you are working on a fix, I'm done with this app.,2.1
I'll never fully trust your app again.,4.1
So far so good until the recent two updates that failed the authentication check.,1.2
Update has broken it It was working really well until the last update, now I can no longer send or receive mail and get connection errors.,1.2
Now I can't connect to any servers to retrieve emails.,1.4
Frustration reigns, time lost and still can't get my email.,2.3
Poor after update Was great till recent update that crashes its database.,1.2
PLEASE FIX THIS, it has only started doing this with the latest update and makes k9 essentially useless.,4.2
With the update I can't sync with the server and am not getting any emails,1.2
Please fix this or simply pull the update.,1.2
This free solution cured my problems and seems to work better overall.,3
Used to work Authentication of Office365 account fails even though details have not changed,3
Please fix.,4.2
Good one Used for years, but after latest update html is not working correctly in the body of messages,2.1
However, v5.201 crashes whenever one steels to view an email on Samsung Galaxy s5.,1.3
It reports null pointer dereference on one of my accounts and ssl handshake error on the other plus there is annoying confirmation dialog on mark all as read which can't be switched off.,2.7
v5.201: can't use it.,2.5
V5.201 doesn't display controls when reading individual emails.,2.5
Lynn I have used this for years and loved it now with.the update I have problem with the mail format.,1.2
Can't get rid of the From To CC BCC and description.,4.1
Anyhow I cannot fix so have uninstalled.,2.1
Poor upgrade The upgrading of database still doesn't work.,2.1
I have not been able to access my emails still.,2.1
I cannot receive or delete email.,2.3
Don't need the extensive list of options per email with poor defaults.,2.1
Got 12 emails, don't need hundreds of options needing changed.,3
Let me set one default preset that all emails will adopt by default, just set a button to set email to default preset, then people can change few things they want to change, but make most their setting set to defaults they want easily.,2.1
Dropping APG for a gpg solution that doesn't work was colossally stupid.,2.1
Database upgrade fails Can't access any emails or make backups thanks to latest update.,1.2
Auth Failed The new update always gives me auth fail for gmail.,1.2
2017 UPDATE (original review 2013) - For approx' 5 years I've used K9 as my main email client.,1.2
The setup is still a problem, complete hit or miss.,3
Once I open mail it crashes out.,1.3
Final straw happened a few days ago when I experienced serious internet connectivity problems, only to discover that K9 Mail had used over 60GB of wifi data over the previous month.,1.4
Won't work with Yahoo Mail Cannot use with new Yahoo secure sign in.,1..5
Wonky app Things that no longer work: - list items don't gray out after reading them - unable to mark or place a star on listed mail - deletion mail from within them doesn't work, moving a piece of mail to a folder doesn't move it - not all mail in list is present.,2.7
Updating and Crashing Since the update all I can do is upgrade folders, then it crashes.,1.2
Please fix.,4.2
Just did the latest update but now I can't zoom the message in or out.,1.2
Don't trust I used this app for a long time.,4.1
You get 1 to 2 lines of text that you have to scroll to make your choice: select, delete, move, or whatever options there are.,3
BUT I can't say anything good about until I can momento my password  exactly.,4.1
Also, what's the point in spam folder when you can't mark things as spam?,3
Could be a little more simple when setting up (like auto poll not working until background sync is set to always) but once sorted it's a good mail client (other than the above issues).,3
Used to love it But it doesn't work with 2 step encryption now, can't even log in.,1.5
sometimes mail gets stuck in the outbox or fails to delete messages or fails to load a message.,2.1
...but the keyword search will not go far back in the archive.,2.1
No real exchange support without webdav I really wanted to try it but without real exchange support its worthless to me.,2.1
Couldn't even get past the sign up page; 3 links were dead.,2.1
Can't send emai No matter what I do I can't send email.,2.1
4 days no email from google does any one even support this app anymore.,2.1
Won't work with Yahoo or Gmail With Yahoo and Gmail I get not the right user name or password.,2.7
Unable to add another gmail account Fix the errors.,2.7
Google authenticator support plx Cannot login to my gmail, guess why.,2.7
Update: Cannot handle more than one email account other than that I'd give it 5 stars.,1.2
I can't connect my work exchange account.,1.4
I like the app, but I can't use it until I can connect to my work email.,1.4
Unfortunately K9 crashes randomly on Android 6.01 (Moto g4 plus).,1.6
I cannot send email from my AOL accounts.,2.3
Can't edit connection after initial setup as far as I can see so reinstalled having read that initially setting up over WiFi may have been the problem (!),1.4
Update doesn't work.,1.2
Maybe it's caused by me being in China, but given that the mail server is in China also I fail to see why it doesn't work correctly.,1.4
Accessibility issues - fonts Devs: Only a set range of font sizes are available, which is a blemish on an otherwise awesome app.,3
Now everytime I try to delete mail it freezes and crashes.,1.3
Fix it,or pull it.,4.1
Push mail do not work.,1.3
It is good interface, but push nail do not work and dep end entirely on polling.,2.1

Unified Inbox fails to show new messages.,2.1
Keep getting "no text" or "no subject" connection error when I open mail.,2.1
Push isn't reliable When the display is off for a couple of hours, push notifications aren't sent any more and a manual poll has to be done to resolve the issue.,2.1
Doesn't deliver important e-mails Used for 2 years but has consistently failed to deliver e-mails addressed only to me, unless they're spasm.,3
There are lots of issues, but the latest bug is in that when sending emails they often time out instantly and I get a "failed to send" notification in my notification bar and they remain in the outbox.,1.4	
Can't use it.,4.2
I've cleared my cache, now tried uninstalling and reinstalling but get so far in the setting up process and each time the app just crashes, over and over.,1.3
Today I missed a very important email because of this, and STILL can't get it to work.2.7
Great for searching older emails Could use a more clean design.,2.4
Notifications no longer work Syncing correctly on Motorola phone, but as of a few weeks ago no longer displays notifications (they are switched on for the app and other apps all working fine).,2.1
Please fix.,4.2
Doesn't sync Sync is disabled with no way to enable it, so notifications don't work.,2.1

Needs updating Will not auto sync with Marshmallow 6.0.1 on LG G5.,1.2
The format on my screen is impossible.,4.2
Can't return the mail to my inbox - too much beating around the bush!,2.1
Can't risk missing any important messages, so next step: TOTAL REMOVAL (uninstalling it, if that's your jargon).,3

I hoped that it stays on my phone for ever but the recent sync issues have been a problem for me.,2.7
Fix this problem will return back to 5 stars.,4.1
It is with real regret that I am probably going to uninstall it because I can't get it to work for me.,4.1

Poor No resizing for fotos,doesn't show pics size when attached.,2.1
Can't connect to hotmail account I actually love the app but for some reason I cannot sync with my hotmail account.,1.4
I find it odd that no other mail app I've used had this problem, yet this is supposed to be one of the best mail apps available.,2.1
Can't save attachments, better than default mail client I've been Using k-9 for years.,2.1
But its become buggy/unstable and now I am faced with syncing disabled and no way to fix it.,2.1
