Irrespective of whether using android keyboard or third party, trying to enter credentials into app to connect to Trakt makes the data entry lines unreadable -- keyboard takes up half the screen -- doesn't work in main app -- but still what's the point -- there are now several apps permitting tracking of shows, so can't see the point of using this if you cannot enter ALL data correctly.,1.6
