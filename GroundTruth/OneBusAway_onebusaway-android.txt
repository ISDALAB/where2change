This never works properly,all the time the time estimated by this app is way different than the the actual time.,2.2
Can't star stops anymore.,2.1
Time I add a star to a stop it doesn't show I have any stops starred in the tab.,2.2
The app is super faulty Some of the buses won't even show up on the schedule until it actually comes.,2.2
You can't even tell if the bus had left or yet to arrive because it's so faulty.,2.2
You cant type in an address so how are you supposed to figure out how to get there??,2.2
Uber can show real time vehicle location why can't OBA?,2.1
If all you want is location of bus stops and route maps this app will probably be fine.,2.2
Hasn't been working Anyone know of another app like this?,4.1
This app is worthless I preferred the texting app this just drains my data and then doesn't work.,1.3
I'll try to reload again but not looking forward to getting my hopes up.,4.1
Worked great Have recently been having issues in OPO.,2.1
App won't even load.,1.3
I have to re list all my saved stops every time they update the app.,2.7
Update broke app Please fix,1.2
Nothing but crashes on latest version.,1.2
but now I don't like it at all.,4.1
Don't count on this app!,4.2
Used to be very reliable but now it crashes a lot,4.1
Not helpful This app used to work, now it's not working in Gwinnett county.,4.1
Don't waste your time with this app or seattle metro.,4.1
This is especially annoying when I go between routes to check times, and can't get anything to reconnect.,2.1
Stupid path cant download The text from bust stop has link to download but can't unless google sends code to phone via text.,2.3
Cant read text unless backing out of download sequence.,2.3
worked better before the updates This App worked great then i downloaded the recent update and now it gives me the wrong times,doesn't give real time status like it use to, and also frequently says "unable to give stops" so at times it doesn't work whats the point of an app if it doesn't work.,1.3
Now doesn't work.,4.2
Don't download this...like cake.,4.2
Don't plan around it or you will be sorely disappointed.,4.1
Also no matter how many times I try I can NEVER report a problem.It will always instruct me to "try again later because of an error.",2.3
Glitch Updated it to the new style and what not and I can't even open it anymore because it crashes before I can use it and I use this.,1.3
Used to work, now it's constantly crashing Constantly crashing on my S6.,1.3
I can't tell what's really so awful here, Seattle's buses or this app.,4.1
Buses don't show up It says a bus will be there at some time, and it shows the bus moving on the map, but then the bus doesn't show up/doesn't seem to actually exist.,2.2
Piece of junk Doesnt update bus info, when it does, its incorrect info that change draatically.,2.1
However, now it only shows random busses and you have to click, scroll, and find the right one since they aren't all represented.,2.2
Is there a way to Uninstall the updates so I can use the old version?,1.2
Update screw-up The app use to work fine, but now with the new update, the app can't find my location, and the screen doesn't even move to your location like it use to.,1.2
Please fix this app or let people reinstall the older version of this app.,1.2
Not real time Times are innacurate, when you tap on a stop it will show you all the busses from 5 hrs ago and you have to scroll down to look for the right one, and even when you find it, it's not real time.,2.2
It was a lot better before they updated it now it sucks.,1.2
I never had to add my location before it just popped up now it is all messed up,2.7
Dont need graphics of buildings.,4.2
Don't want to install Google Maps Then new upbeats requires Google Maps install.,4.1
Why 'fix' it?,4.2
Is there a way to prevent the horrible update from downloading again?,1.2
Update Issues Really like the old version and was easier to use.,1.2
Please fix.,4.2
Oh I smashed my phone Its SOO buggy and by that I mean I can open the app without it closing immediately, so I can't get the info I need.,2.1
Doesn't even have it listed at my stop I have to use the stop before mine to even see when it's coming but even then it isn't accurate!,2.2
Yes, I "got it" New version looks slick and all but constantly pops up tutorial dialogs about things I already know how to do.,2.1
Routes at a stop are a star instead of a filter, and is now two and three steps and very slow Someone failed user ease class, never go ten clicks when two will do.,2.2
Don't much care for it on my android phone.,1.6
Either there is a glitch in the app and a mistake in the written schedule, or someone is juking the stats.,1.3
Updates too much Updates every 30 seconds and proceeds to jump to top of list.,1.2
Doesn't work No bus stops even pop up,2.1
My BlackBerry Classic crashes every time I touch a stop icon.,1.3
It also has issues locating me.,2.2
Used to Work Hasn't worked in months.,1.3
I am also unable to send error reports.,2.3
Doesn't work anymore.,1.3
Fix this app 345 not showing, inaccurate 5,4.2
It's terrible...can't configure,4.2
But whn there is a problem it will not allow me to report it.,2.3
I thought it was my phone but ive tried it on 2different once to arrive at the same issue.,4.2
Not having access without wi-fi, I can't speak to how accurate arrivals have been, but it was useful for telling me when to leave the house and how to plan my trips.,1.4
Not to mention that I can't easily switch between two stops (because sometimes I have a choice about which bus to take depending on which will arrive sooner between stops that are only a block apart.),2.2
And I notice that the view for the stops have a star I can add at the top, so there SEEMS to still be favourites, but how can I view them?,2.2
Glitched All the buses just say their -1500 minutes awau, daylight savings messed it up i think, plz fix,2.2
Broken Keeps saying something went wrong and to try again,1.3
Doesn't work Just keeps giving an error message and won't find any routes,2.1
Usually Can't update location I have a One Plus One phone and Ab H2O connection.,2.1
Most of the time the app can't find my location,2.2
Plus, it won't even show me the time for the most recent bus that's coming only for the bus an hour away.,2.1
It's bullshit, you can't trust it.,4.1
Have no idea how this app works Can't plug in city to city destinations?,2.3
Don't waste your time with this app, you'll only be frustrated with it.,4.1
This is a privacy risk.,2.6
I tried to submit this through "report a problem", but apparently that doesn't work either.,2.3
Largely unreliable Often just doesn't have expected times so it just shows the schedule.,2.2
Does not work propeely It gives the option to report problems but it never allows you to send the report.,2.3
Not always accurate I just missed my bus because instead of being 20 mins late like it said, it was a minute early.,2.2
Not impressed Why can't we edit our starred stops or organize them?,2.7
Just use Google Maps if you live in King County area of Washington.,2.2
The doesn't even work I put into stop number and no information comes,2.1
Used to work great till they updated it now it just keeps shutting down,1.2
It's doesn't work almost every time!,1.3
Not sure what the problem is but accuracy is not this app's forte.,2.2
Does not work right I use to love this app but now it only gives me the scheduled arrival and scheduled leave times in black in no longer gives up to the min data on if it is on time, late, or early witch has been giving me alot of problems trying to make it to were i need to go on time this is my only s,2.2
What's the problem.,4.2
Please fix.,4.2
This used to be a great app now 90% of the time it just says scheduled arrival in black for just about every bus at every stop.,2.2
It doesn't work on this android phone!,1.6
Recurring reminders don't always work.,2.1
Says error when I try to report a problem Please fix this and route 143 to downtown Seattle (it's always late)!!!,2.3
Doesn't work on android,1.6
Can't say how many times I've waited 10 minutes for a bus only for it to tell me it came two minutes ago.,2.2
Oh and my wife doesn't have a problem.,4.2
Extremely unreliable The UI is rather anti-intuitive at times, but the real problem is that this app is extremely unreliable.,2.8
On average it is about 3-4 minutes off, either early or later than actual time, but not consistently off so you can't adjust.,2.3
Sometimes it says it will leave on time, but the bus is 15 minutes late.,2.3
You can't even ballpark a general time.,4.2
Doesn't work, used to work very well but hasn't.,4.2
Can't tell you how many times its claimed my bus came and went without any bus showing up at all.,2.2
I send a message everytime they're early and late (or don't come at all.),2.3
Don't know if I'll be keeping this app.,4.2
Just didn't work for me There was no autofill, when I entered street address only, it sent me somewhere on the other side of the state.,2.2
Fix bugs This app is great when it works right.,4.1
Fix this issue please I don't know if it's an android issue or note 4 issue which is the phone I have.,1.6
Fix please,4.2
Recent update is terrible Don't know what happened, but it's completely off schedule now.,4.2
Fix it!,4.2
Can be accurate but most of the times it's really off Thank you, developers for constantly fixing the issues that the users suggested.,2.2
Its so confusing to use The app is really reliable bus time and route wise but the UI is horrible and the fact that u can only go by routes and stops is ridiculous because most of my stops dont show the route number on them and i dont know the routes im taking because im foreign to here.,2.2
It's ok But why it don't show the weekend,2.1
You can't see multiple routes at once, can't plan a trip, doesn't figure out routes.,2.1
Now it's not accurate, bombs, can't report problem.,2.3
Not anymore I have had used this app for awhile but recently it is showing not only inaccuracies of the schedules but also the GPS has failed to locate the right locations,2.2
Please fix Can't send report error,2.3
Almost useful I am giving the app 1 star because I have had a recurring problem with inaccurate info on the bus across the street from my house, and when I tried to send feedback it won't let me send the report.,2.2
It doesnt work as intended Simply because the people driving the busses report incorrect times, they do not stop at the corect spots, they do not even keep to their own schedules.,2.2
If the bus was a restaurant I'd never come back, because now the report button for bad drivers amd incorrect times doesn't even work anymore.,2.2
Useless reporting problem option How can you report a problem with the bus if you can't actually report the problem?,2.3
Can got fix this or take the option off.,4.2
It tells you it's "Unable to send.,2.3
Tulsa is NOT SEATTLE Used this app for years loved it used daily BUT UPDATED NOW IT HAS ME IN TULSA NOT SEATTLE WHY CAN'T U JUST LEAVE GOOD THINGS ALONE,2.2
What is the problem?,4.2
Many alerts AFTER your bus has departed AND HAS SEVERE ISSUES FINDING MY LOCATION ON A Samsung Note 2!!!!,1.6
Why can't i report problems this app is soooo messed up Estimated arrival time is wrong most of the time and it never let's me send reports for problems.,2.3
Still cant send reports, fix this and the app will be 5 stars,2.3
Recently I've not been able to even get a report through.,2.3
Great app but please fix where I can't report any of the rides.,2.1
It can't find my location or any of the stops and bus numbers I try to manually put in.,2.1
You people suck thank you for asking,4.2
Stopped Working The android version has always been a disappointment but now it can't even find my location.,1.6
Manual entry of location also not working.,2.1
Please fix.,4.2
Apparently this is a problem with Sound Transit, & not the app itself.,2.5
Don't know of this is a problem with the buses or the app but it's annoying.,2.2
I can't even edit the name of the bus stop I want to keep or have a bookmark place for my stops for me to go back to like the iPhone.,2.7
Doesn't work.,4.2
Can't get any stops.,4.2
It's so so You just have to know how to manage the app although it seems like its perfect its not.,4.2
I notice a couple of bugs in it is far as accuracy.,2.2
Please fix.,4.2
Not sure what happened This app used to be spot on, but I can't trust it at all anymore.,4.1
This app didn't work,1.3
Can't trust arrivals Frequently off by 10+ minutes.,4.2
Just use Google maps Nuff said,4.2
Doesn't show variances for weekend routes I think the app is only showing departures for weekday routes.,2.2
Can't trust it!,4.1
It started out decent, freezing my phone occasionally, and now my GNex reboots every time I try to use this.,1.3
it wont work Cant get it to work,1.3
Fix it or disable it so future generations don't end with a poorly put together app.,1.3
Something is wrong This used to be pretty good, but it doesn't work anymore.,4.2
Location fail after a few days,2.7
And that's not a good thing when you're trying to get to and from work.,4.1
Fix it!,4.2
Bad app Useless on holidays guy on phone says app dose not work on holidays due to Sunday schedule on holidays,2.1
Bus Stops Please update the busses streets and schedules and will give 5 stars,3
Boo Doesn't show Gwinnett county transit.,2.2
Compared it against the published times (it just uses scheduled times, not actual times) and saw it had the wrong info.,2.2
Pretty basic fail.,4.2
Holiday schedule doesn't work I waited for the bus this morning for an hour, no bus came when it said there was one.,2.2
You know, so people don't end up at a bus stop thinking the bus will be there in 10 minutes but won't actually be there for an hour.,2.2
The android app does not do this.,1.6
Could Use a little more Its very accurate on time although it would Usefull to have a plan your trip thing where you type in the adress you are going to from your current location.and it then tells you where and what bus(s) to catch,3
This app sucks it keeps saying oops something g went wrong and not loading until I refresh the page like 4 times,2.5
Not accurate DO NOT TRUST THIS APP!,4.2
WASTE OF TIME 1 star from 2 cause u cant even access the site from a mobile device.,2.1
Please fix.,4.2
Still not working.,4.2
Please fix.,4.2
Never works I used to like this app but for some reason it doesn't ever load up the buses anymore.,2.1
Please fix.,4.2
The E-Line shows as 675 which can be a bit misleading, why doesn't it show links the other A-D Lines?,2.2
Don't work on cloudy days.,4.2
Please fix.,4.2
Every time I search a stop, it won't work.,2.4
I've had 0 problems with this app until today.,4.2
Please fix.,4.2
Still crashes phone fairly frequently I wrote a review a while back in September that I accidentally deleted when I went to update it today (January).,4.2
This app, while useful, still has the very annoying feature that it often crashes my phone when I click the back button on the 'list of coming buses' page for a given bus stop.,1.3
None of the app updates have fixed this issue, at least not permanently.,1.2
GPS / location doesn't work It can never find where I am.,2.1
I have already submitted a bug but I have not heard back from them.,2.3
And I tried to send as report but it said error and wouldn't send.,2.3
Crap compared to iOS version Can't view the route on a map?,1.6
One you have the route selected, can't access expected arrival times for each stop?,2.1
Metro couldn't've done it better themselves (but that's not saying much based on THEIR site) but why such an ugly UI?,2.8
Does not give correct times And I can't the see number of the bus that is coming by,2.2
The app could never find my location,2.1
Now, however, even after updating, it is regularly unable to find my location, unable to locate stops.,2.1
It can never find my location.,2.1
Doesn't work anymore.,1.3
It won't even recognize the assigned numbers for the bus stops.,2.1
However, minus 2 stars for not working on weekends or holidays.,2.1
Very pooor Never works never can get a fix on my location worst app ever,2.1
Can't get it to do anything but chug away Galaxy Note 2 with Verizon.,1.6
I posted this review about an hour ago and they erased it off of their site.,4.2
Now it just shows scheduled arrival time.,2.2
Please fix.,4.2
You can use this to find out when the next bus will arrive at your stop, but you can't use it to find how how to get to a particular destination.,2.2
You have to go to KC Metro web site to do that, and that site isn't mobile device friendly.,2.5
GPS location doesn't work anymore GPS location on galaxy s3 no longer working,2.1
Bad app This app needs work you can't get the bus stops to show up.,2.1
The settings suck you cant put your location in unless you live in Washington.,2.2
Would be a great app if the developer can fix these problems!,3
Do NOT rely on it for getting to your bus on time.,2.2
No longer works for sounder or light rail Works fine for buses.,2.2
No longer works for the sounder or the light rail.,2.2
This may be down to the source of the data rather than the app, but that doesn't change the fact that this is now useless for anyone who rides the train.,2.2
Doesn't work Seems to close without loading past a black page on my galaxy nexus, 4.2.1,2.8
Even if this was just a one-off oversight, it significantly reduced my confidence in the app and from now on I'll double check the King County Metro timetables before heading out the door.,2.2
Since it auto-centers, it makes it really frustrating to research stops/routes that you may not be near at that moment.,4.1
Can't pick up location?,2.1
Whenever I start the app, it tries to get a fix and it can't pick it up.,1.3
One bus away nope more like Away more than one bus goes I like the app but its to slow finding my location takes like 10 minutes and sometimes it won't even find it,2.2
Unreliable Never works,4.2
I'm actually very unhappy here.,4.1
Fix it!,4.2
Was good...fix alerts please I know my phone is kinds old (samsung galaxy s), but after the updates my alerts are all not working.,1.2
Please fix.,4.2
PLEASE FIX!!,4.2
Meh Very confusing for a person who doesn't know the bus routes by number and is planning a future trip.,2.2
However it often has issues .,4.2
My biggest issue though is that it doesn't factor holidays at all.,2.2
Please fix.,4.2
I thought updates were good things?,4.1
You can't trust it until you're on the bus.,4.1
Please fix, without atleast some accuracy its worthless.,2.2
Only us Seems to only support us,4.2
No help I like the app for its simplicity but i have not been able to find instructions or information on what the colors mean or any info on how to go beyond the basics.,2.1
Doesn't show any Metro busses in Seattle.,2.2
Please fix.,4.2
Always crashing and losing route/stop info.,1.3
Crap Does not work in my city in the uk,4.1
Thank you for updating it!,4.2
Doesn't work anymore.,1.3
Unsatisfied Doesn't show my bus anymore.,2.1
Dont download.,4.1
But now doesn't give me any predicted times for my stops.,2.1
It always just shows the scheduled arrival time...which is useless.,3
Please fix whatever you did that made this application stop working!!,1.3
Needs to be updated The app is a great idea, easy to use, but the timing is off.,2.1
It told me the bus is here now but I'm still waiting in the cold for the 120,2.2
So please fix this?,4.2
Not great The user interface could use some work.,2.8
just track the buses and tell us where they're at.,3
Please.PLEASE fix this!,4.2
Sometimes, it doesn't work.,1.3
It is helpful at telling what time the bus is supposed to be there though and that's why I cannot uninstall it.,4.2
Won't work tells notimes at all horrible app,2.1
This app used to work good now it doesn't even show my rout.,2.1
Not working It just stopped working today...so annoying :/,1.3
The app used to be rock solid and now it doesn't work!,1.3
Not this app's problems.,4.2
Not sure where the problem is, on your end or the transit company supplying the route data, but either way it can be frustrating.,2.1
What happen When I first started using this app it was great.,4.1
Fix bus times,4.1
Onec apon a time,,, I planned my schedule around oba.,4.1
Cannot be relied upon in the slightest for either time or rout.,4.1
Don't waste your time with this app.,4.1
The app knows this information, because under 'Show route information' it will show the route broken up into sections, but you can't display it that way, and you have to dig around to even find that much.,2.1
The iPhone version has a way to display the other section, but you have to scroll to the bottom of the list of stops.,2.8
Can't tell you how many times I either missed my bus, or ran like a crazy person only to wait for 20 minutes or so.,4.1
The invisibus is here!,4.1
And WHY would this app need permission to read phone state, model and serial number?,2.2
Good in theory - but doesnt work Gives wrong info.,2.3
Please fix.,4.2
FIX IT FIX IT!,4.2
App will not start on Epic,1.3
Hasn't worked in 2 days!,1.3
Useless and has made me very late numerous times.,4.1
You have to know the route numbers to use this,4.1
It doesn't find eastside buses as well as it does those along the I-5 corridor.,2.2
I don't know if it is an issue with Metro or with the development of the app, but don't rely on it.,2.5
I would use this app to check a bus time and close it.,2.2
In the past I couldn't live without it but now I'm considering deleting it from my phone.,4.1
Please fix.,4.2
but doesn't anymore what's the deal please fix,4.2
Like they all said, the latest update is a bug in and of itself.,4.1
Please fix.,4.2
After I updated my route is no longer available.,2.7
Please fix.,4.2
Don't always connect.,4.2
DONT WORK!,4.2Wouldn't work on my Evo (2.2).,1.6
Doesnt show my true location, not even close to it.,2.1
This would be a great app if there were a way to see route destinations by selecting "show route" and then one of the numbers of routes shown.,3
It would be nice to set a destination arrival reminder.,3
Doesn't show the scores of bus routes for Community Transit or Sound Transit that service Seattle - apparently only Metro Transit.,2.1
